# AWS CodeCommit Research
Written by: Jorge

The AWS CodeCommit is, in summary, similar to github in terms of providing a web based interface (and CLI as well) for collaboration and managing git based repositories.
 
The AWS CodeCommit has all the main features that github has such as Pull Requests, branching, viewing commit differences and the rest. In addition, AWS CodeCommit has the added benefit of being integrated with the rest of AWS services such as CloudFormation, CodeBuild, CodePipeline. Furthermore AWS CodeCommit has a free tier which allows private repositories - something that is not available in GitHub. 

However AWS CodeCommit limits the free tier to 5 active users. Each additional user would incur a $1 cost per month. Currently we have 6 members in our team (with Ruth that would be 7 since we would give her access as well).

In conclusion - I would recommend that we continue to use GitHub for the project. GitHub is free, and we don't really need privacy for this project. Additionally, I assume that a GitHub repository, given its popularity, should be easiy integrated with the rest of the AWS services if we decide to use any of them for CI/CD purposes.
