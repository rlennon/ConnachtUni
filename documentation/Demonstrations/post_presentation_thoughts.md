This document is intended to capture thoughts on possible improvements from the team after the project presentation on JUne 19th.

Ideas from Matthew:
1. Provide a better description of how our work on the team project relates to the topic of DevOps.  This could come either at the very beginning or at the very end of the slide deck.
2. Enhance the security of the project.  Ideas include specifying a specidic range of IP addresses that are allowed to connect to the application.  Another idea is to set a password reset policy (90 days for example).
