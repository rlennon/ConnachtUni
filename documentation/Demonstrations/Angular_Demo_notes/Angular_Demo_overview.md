# In this demo we will see

 - How to install the nginx web server on an EC2 instance.
 - How to create an Angular project, build it, deploy it* and view the
   home page in a browser.

# How this demo fits into our project

 - We will have the requisite knowledge to get a simple “hello world”
   web site up and running.
 - We can use the nginx install steps to configure Staging and
   Production EC2 instances.
 - We can use the nginx and Angular install steps can to configure a
   build server.

# How this demo fits into the DevOps practice

Configured EC2 instances able to build and host our site are necessary components in the following:

 - Automate code builds, tests, and deployments
 - Continuous integration

*This is non-optimal
