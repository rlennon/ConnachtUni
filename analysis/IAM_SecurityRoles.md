It is also recommended to require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all IAM users for an added level of security. With MFA, users have a device that generates a response to an authentication challenge. 

The response is generated in one of the following ways:
- Virtual and hardware MFA devices generate a code that you view on the app or device and then enter on the sign-in screen.

- U2F security keys generate a response when you tap the device. The user does not manually enter a code on the sign-in screen.

It is also recommended to use U2F or hardware MFA devices for privileged IAM users who are allowed to access sensitive resources or API operations.
