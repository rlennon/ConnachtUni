# IAM Security Roles

### Purpose - To determine IAM security roles to be given to the project team.


Original creator creates IAM user role and gives it admin privileges.

Create individual users for anyone who needs to access the AWS account. 
- This gives each user a unique set of security credentials, which can be changed or revoked at anytime

## Recommendation
Create the following groups:
- **Administrator:** Permissions Management
- **Developer:** Write, Tagging
- **User:** List, Read

It is also recommended to require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all IAM users for an added level of security. With MFA, users have a device that generates a response to an authentication challenge. 

The response is generated in one of the following ways:
- Virtual and hardware MFA devices generate a code that you view on the app or device and then enter on the sign-in screen.

- U2F security keys generate a response when you tap the device. The user does not manually enter a code on the sign-in screen.

It is also recommended to use U2F or hardware MFA devices for privileged IAM users who are allowed to access sensitive resources or API operations.
