 Notes taken by: Matthew Erler
 
 The team has reviewed the README mark down file in the ConnachtUni GitHub repository.  
 Staphanie wasn't clear on what the repository is for as it pertains to the document that Ruth committed to it.
 Jorge explained that GitHub is a repository for any and all documents and/or files.  Matthew explained that GitHub
 repos can be used to store any information.  As examples Matthew said that a queriable DB of police shootings is
 available in a GitHub repository as well as multimedia items saved from Chinese sources pertaining to Covid-19.
 The team started to organize itself so that work is divided up evenly and each person has work to commit weekly.
 Jorge said that we should start thinking about using Gira.
 Stephamie said that we should schedule stand-ups more than twice a week.
 Jorge doesn't see a lot of value in the Standup Alice bot.  Stephanie is under the impression that we are required
 to use Standup Alice.  Elizabeth remembers Ruth saying that Standup Alice is just a possible tool to use and
 not required.  Matthew said that we will know more after planning in Jira.  Matthew suggested 1 week sprints since
 we have only 7 weeks.  Jorge took the action item of reaching out to Ruth to determine if we are expected to update
 the Social Contract section of README.md.  The team made the following Social Contract decisions
 Stand-ups will occur 3 times a week (M,W,F) at 3:00 PM CST
 
 Matthew's understanding is that participation is graded so we need to make good documentation that records people's participation.
 Matthew asked (on slack) Ruth if there is a rubric.  Matthew suggested doing sprint planning on the weekends.  The response wasn't
 really positive on that idea but the team decided to meet 8 AM CST Saturdays.  Matthew scheduled reoccuring weekly meetings.
 Matthew volunteered to help people understand GitHub.
 Matthew suggested that we read README.md from top to bottom and bring questions to class on Tueasday.
