**Attendees**
- Jorge Castaneda
- Phani Darpureddy
- Matthew Erler
- Elizabeth Taillon   (notes)
- Stephanie Weaver


### Notes:

Team discussed the project demo for Friday 2020-06-19.
  - Viewed the list of discussion points the instructor shared during class.
  - Need to make sure each person has a technical aspect they can talk about.
  - Need to discuss what technology we used, and the justification for why we chose it.
  - Proposal:
    - Show the automated pipeline with 'hello world'.
    - Show the angular code & the unittesting capability.
    - Discuss how our next step would be to bring angular code into the pipeline.
    - Discuss other key pieces we researched.
  - Stephanie shared a powerpoint template she created for the presentation.
    - In the GitHub 'documentation/Demonstrations/' folder:  [Connacht_University_TeamDC.pptx](https://github.com/rlennon/ConnachtUni/blob/Documentation/documentation/Demonstrations/Connacht_University_TeamDC.pptx).
    - Each topic would be one slide, created by the assigned team member.
    - Bullet points, not paragraphs.
    - Stephanie will share her screen for the 'Application development' section.
    - Phani will share his screen for the 'Application provision & deployment' section.
    - As each person's topic is shown, they will speak to it.
  - We only have 30 minutes for the presentation.
    - Each person will speak briefly about their topic, just a few sentences.
    - We won't have enough time to do live demos for everything, but we can use screenshots.
    - Phani offered to prepare a pipeline in advance.
  - **Team will have a dry run of the demo on Thursday, at the team meeting.**
    - Each person should update the powerpoint with their slide(s) by Thursday's meeting.
